Tripuri cuisine is the type of food served in Tripura (situated in northeast India). The Tripuris are essentially nonvegetarians
and hence the main courses are mainly prepared using meat, but with the addition of vegetables. Traditional Tripuri cuisine
is known as Mui Borok. Tripuri food has a key ingredient called Berma (also called Shidal in Bengali), which is a small,
oil-pasted and dry fermented fish. The foods are sometimes considered to be healthy as they are usually prepared without oil.
Tripuri food such as bangui rice and fish stews, Muya (Bamboo shoot), local fishes, vegetables, herbs, Batema (this jelly-like
food is prepared by making a paste of Batema plant's corm or tuber (Elephant foot yam) with sodium powder and water to remove
its raphide. After making the paste into bun-shaped, they are boiled with water containing sodium powder. Since lack of sodium
powder cause throat to itch, they are cut into pieces and preferred with fresh pasted garlic, and Mosdeng), wahan moso
(prepared by adding boiled pork, onion pieces, salt, pasted ginger and roasted green chilli paste) and roasted meat are
extremely popular within and outside the state.
