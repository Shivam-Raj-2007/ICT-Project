    <h1>Folk Songs Of Tripura</h1>
    The Tripuri folk songs in called Tipra Bharot.The folk songs are as old as the tribe and they have survived through the ages as a tradition. The Tripuri folk songs arc widely spread over the entire community like all other folk songs of other regions. These songs were composed in the early days of their collective living by individuals whose identity is unrecognizable and ignored. The folk songs are based on old traditions, thoughts, desires, love, jhum cultivation, harvesting, festivals, beliefs and superstitions etc. The theme of the songs has outlived the time without any deviations and till today the folksongs are sung in original form or with slight variations, spontaneously and enthusiastically by the people.

In Tripuri language, song means 'Rwchabmung', the tune of Tripuri songs maintain the respective style in rhythm which is entirely based on their tradition.

Now-a-days, many Tripuris sing the Kok Borok (Tirpuri) Songs imitating the tune of other modern songs, especially the Hindi. This trend is found since the inception of Kokborok programme in the All India Radio Centre at Agartala. Apart from it, the music director of the present days, out of their artistic talent and capability compose new tunes. Notwithstanding the recent trend to imitate the tune of songs belonging to other communities, the original Tripuri songs are very much popular antorig the Tripuri people for their melodious tune and lyrical composition.

It is really impossible to identify the individuals connected with the composition of these traditional folksongs. From these songs, one can have a glimpse of the ancient constitution of the society, its environment and livelihood. These folksongs also throw light on their desire, achievements, sorrow, happiness and also their short comings. Modern Tripuri songs are composed with new words and tunes but it cannot be denied that sometimes we find more pleasure in old rhymes in old tune.

The folk songs of Tripur√§, as of any other region, depict a many sided picture of the people of the land, and its social, ritual and religious structure. Although Tripuri remains a spoken language only or what we call a dialect, yet their folk literature is quite rich. The folk songs and tales display profound thought and imagination, and have a beautiful rhyme. The spontaneous flow of songs one bears on any religious or social occasion leads one to believe that the Tripuris possess an inborn capacity to compose songs and verses. The unsophisticated village people, particularly the simple and charming girls, express their imagination, love and sorrow through songs and tales. The Tripuri mothers give instruction to their daughters and sons-in- law and daughters-in-law through their songs. Moral lessons are imparted to the youth and children through tales. The green valley, river banks, uphill and the meadows echo and re-echo the sweet and delightful songs of the Tripuri girls. The melodious bamboo flute (sumui-banshi) accompanying the songs provides a serene atmosphere. Throughout the day the people in the village toil hard, yet they-particularly the younger ones-steal time to compose and sing songs. It is difficult to convey, in translation the exact meaning or the rhythm of the folk songs; however, the two specimen below may give some idea of the charm of the Tripuri folk song.<br><br>
