<h2><font color="#4285f4">Madhubani Painting</font></h2>
Madhubani painting or Mithila is a traditional Indian art  form mostly done by women. Madhubani paintings mostly depict nature
and Hindu  religious motifs, and the themes generally revolve around Hindu deities like  Krishna, Ram, Shiva, Durga, Lakshmi, and
Saraswati. It is believed to be  originated at the time of Ramayana, when king Janak commissioned artists to make  paintings for
his daughter, Sita’s marriage with Rama. Natural objects like the  sun, the moon, and religious plants like Tulsi are also widely
painted, along  with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. These  paintings were usually made on the eve
of important dates, to mark the  ceremonies to be performed, like a wedding, festivals, religious events etc.  Traditionally,
rice ground into paste was used to create these works of art  which is still followed till this date. Generally no space is left
empty; the  gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric  designs. This painting was originally
done on freshly plastered wall but, now  it is made on clothes and canvasses as well. In the recent times, it has acquired a
global appeal. <br><br><br><br>

<h2><font color="#ea4335">Manjusa Art</font></h2>
Manjusa art is believed to be the only art form in the  history of art form in India which has a sequential representation of the
story  and is displayed in a series. This is also called a scroll painting. Manjusa  art is a folk art of Bhagalpur, Bihar, and
has been dated back to the 7th  century. The name Manjusa is also associated with an elaborate story, a goddess  and also a
festival celebrated in Bhagalpur. The Sanskrit word “Manjusa” means  a box and Manjusas are temple shaped boxes, made of bamboo,
Jute-Straw and  Paper inside which the devotees keep their ceremonial materials. These boxes  are however illustrated with
paintings that tell a tale. The tale is that of  Bihula who saved her husband from the deity’s wrath and a snake-bite and also
of Bishahari or Mansa, the snake goddess known for her anger when displeased  but also her fierce protectiveness when
propitiated. Earlier the story called  `Bihula-Bishahari Gatha’ had an oral tradition of being sung though, nowadays  not too
many people sing it, but in Assam and Bengal the tradition is still  continued and the songs are sung with the story of Bihula.
It is a well-known  folk art. In an attempt to save this art form from extinction, in the year 1984  the Bihar government made
an intitative called “Jansampoorna vibagh” in which  they went to the villages of Bhagalpur and showed them slideshows of Manjusa
art and educated people about this traditional art form encouraging them to  revive this age old tradition. This initiative has
led to other governmental  and non-governmental organisations to come up with unique plans to promote this  art form by using them
 as a mode of communication in various schemes.<br><br><br><br>

<h2><font color="#fbbc05">Patna School of  Painting</font></h2>
Patna School of Painting or Patna Qalaam (Patna Kalam) or  Company Painting is a style of Indian Painting, which existed in Bihar, India  in the 18th and 19th centuries. An off shoot of Mughal miniature paintings,  Patna Kalam caught the connoisseurs’ eye for its clear stylistic difference and  unusual use of water colours. For the first time, there was a rich coherence  between realism and visual perspective. This style combined elements of the  Mughal and British styles of paintings so well, that it was called the  Feringhee Kalam (the White man’s art). The paintings were done on surfaces as  diverse as paper, mica and even ivory diskettes, which were used as brooches.  That it was the world’s first independent school of painting which dealt  exclusively with the commoner and his lifestyle also helped Patna Kalam  paintings gain in popularity. The subjects of these paintings had always been  the common man and his mundane routines. It’s basically a miniature form of  painting which has, because of its unique style and form, occupied separate  shelves at art galleries in London and museums in Prague.<br><br><br><br>
