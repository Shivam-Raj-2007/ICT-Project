<h1>Folk Dance Of Bihar</h1>
During the famous chhath parva of Bihar, there is much music and a lot of singing of folk songs, both at home and on the
river bank.The historical ballads dealing with the heroic deeds of the freedom fighter Kunwar Singh have also been immortalized
through folk songs in the plain tracts of Bihar. The folk music of Bihar has survived all attacks of modernism. Some performers
of Bihar's traditions have achieved commercial success. For example, Sharda Sinha (b. 1953) sings Bihari language folk songs in
concerts throughout the world and has released many recordings. Maithil musicians, who seem to have been more popular outside
Bihar, enriched Nepalese music and carried the traditions of their Folk songs. Some of the ragas, which may be claimed as special
to Bihar, are 'Nachari', 'Phag', 'Chaita', 'Purbi',’lagani rag’etc.In the religious-type of dance the gods and goddesses are
invoked through dance accompanied by folk-songs and music.<br>
