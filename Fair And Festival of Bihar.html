Ancient Vediv Religion Festivities of Bihar are steeped in history that has no means to fathom. Moreover, history is not always
written by historians but by people who ake up legends. and legends to the skeptics are in fact revelations to the faithful.
At one time Bihar was beyond the pale of Aryan culture and remained free fro the influences of Vedic religion. During this period,
the people of ancient Bihar worshipped the forces of nature, like serpents, stones, trees, Chaityas (funerary mounds) Yakshas
(semi divine beings), etc. Gradually these objects were incorporated into the Aryan pantheon and in exchange Brahmana leadership
and Vedic sacrifices were accepted by the people of this region. The Festivities in Bihar The majority of people are Hindu.So all
traditional Hindu festivals are observed - Holi, Saraswati Puja, Durga Puja or Dusserah, Deepavali, Bhaiya Dooj etc. But there is
one festival that is uniquely associated with Bihar, and that is the festival of Chhath.festivals of bihar Muslims comprise a
vast minority. (At the time of partition of India, in 1947, a very large number of Bihari Muslims migrated to Pakistan - then
comprising of East and West Pakistan. When East Pakistan was liberated from Pakistani rule and became the nation of Bangladesh,
these Bihari Muslims had a second migration, this time to West Pakistan, now simply known as Pakistan. This Bihari minority in
Pakistan is known as "mujahirs" and they are engaged in a fierce fight for their survival in Pakistan.)Christians, although
proportional to the whole population a small minority, are very large in absolute numbers. Many beautiful Catholic and
Protestant church buildings dot the landscape of towns in Bihar. Special mention may be made of Patna and Ranchi. Some examples
are: the St. Joseph's Convent, the St. Xavier's School with its chapel, Padri-Ki-Haveli, and the church at the Holy Family
Hospital in Patna; and the Gossner Evangelical Lutheran Church at Ranchi. Surprisingly, Bihari Sikhs, in the land that gave the
tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, are very few in number. A large number of Sikhs from the Punjab migrated to Bihar during the
partition of India in 1947. This uprooted, but highly enterprising, group of people quickly established itself as very successful
member of the business and industrial community in Bihar. They are now an integral part of the Bihari population. The Harmandir
Takht, the gurudwara that commemorates Guru Gobind Singh, is a sacred place of pilgrimage for the Sikhs. To the Sikhs this holy
place is reverentially known as Patna Sahib. The amalgamation of Vedic and non-Aryan religion was not an easy affair. It is not
surprising to find the Rig Vedic word for festival, Samana, which has been rendered both as ‘battle’ and ‘ ‘festival’. We hear
of Bhima and Arjuna as destroying the great Chaitya on the hills of Rajgir in order to demonstrate their hostility towards
Magadha. Likewise, the Asurs of Gaya were uprooted by Vishnu. The famous Sonepur Cattle fair (deeed to be the largest in the world
) recreates the Gagendra moksha legend, associated with Hariharanatha temple in Sonepur, which was once strongly opposed to Vishnu.
The Cattle fair, beginning with the full moon day of Kartik Purnima (November) commemorates the ancient concord accommplished at Sonepur,
between the opposing sects of Vishnav and Shiva worshippers.
