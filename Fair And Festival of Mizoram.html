The Chapchar Kut Festival is one of the major festivals in Mizoram. This vibrant and colourful festival is special in Mizoram for the fact that it signifies the welcome of Spring season in the state. Thousands of locals and tourists throng to the festival to get a glimpse of the performances and other festivities. In Aizawl, which is the capital of Mizoram, the Chapchar festival also transforms the festivals into a giant carnival. In 1973, the Mizoram government recognized the festival be celebrated by everyone and not just the ethnic groups. Hence the tribal and the agro people celebrate the culture of Mizoram in full glory.
<h2>Mim Kut Festival</h2>

The Mim Kut Festival is yet another important harvest festival in the state of Mizoram. It is dedicated to the loved ones and
the departed souls. The importance of the Mim Kut Festival is also directly related to the importance of the Chapchar festival.
The crops that were sowed during the Chapchar festival are harvested during the Mim Kut Festival in Mizoram. Whilst a lot of
the festivals have a lot of cultural dance and music performances, this festival is more of a ceremony than a carnival.
<h2>Pawl Kut Festival</h2>

By now it should have been evident that harvesting and their produce is near and dear to the Mizoâ€™s. The Pawl Kut Festival
in Mizoram is yet another major festival that happens annually in the state. This is also a harvest festival but with a
different significance from the other festivals mentioned above. The festival was first recorded in the 15th century and
has an interesting backstory to it.
