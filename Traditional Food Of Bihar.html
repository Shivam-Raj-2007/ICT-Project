<h1>Traditional Food Of Bihar</h1>

Bihari cuisine is eaten mainly in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, as well as in the places where people originating from the
state of Bihar have settled: Jharkhand, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mauritius, South Africa, Fiji, some cities of
Pakistan, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Jamaica, and the Caribbean. Bihari cuisine includes Bhojpuri cuisine, Maithil
cuisine and Magahi cuisine.
The cuisine of Bihar is largely similar to North indian cuisine and East Indian cuisines (for example Bengali cuisine). It is
highly seasonal; watery foods such as watermelon and sharbat made from the pulp of the wood-apple fruit are consumed mainly in
the summer months, while dry foods such as preparations made of sesame seeds and poppy seeds are consumed more frequently in the
winter months.
There are numerous Bihari meat dishes, with chicken and mutton being the most common. Fish dishes are especially common in the
Mithila region of North Bihar due to the number of rivers, such as the Sone, Gandak, Ganges and Koshi. Dairy products are consumed
frequently throughout the year, including dahi (yogurt), spiced buttermilk (known as mattha), ghee, lassi and butter.Dishes for
which Bihar is famous include Bihari kebabs, litti chokha, Bihari boti, Bihari chicken masala, sattu paratha
(parathas stuffed with roasted gram flour), chokha (spicy mashed eggplant and potatoes), fish curry and posta-dana ka halwa.
