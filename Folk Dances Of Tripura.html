<h2>Types Of Folk Dances Of Tripura</h2></center>
<dl><dt>
<h3>Garia Dance</h3></dt>
<dd>
The life and culture of Tripuris revolve around Jhum (shifting) cultivation. When the sowing of seeds at a plot of land
selected for Jhum is over by middle of April, they pray to the God 'Garia' for a happy harvest. The celebrations attached
to the Garia Puja continue for seven days when they seek to entertain their beloved deity with song and dance.

  <dt><h3>Lebang Boomani Dance</h3></dt>
  <dd>
After the Garia festival is over, the Tripuris have a time to rest awaiting the monsoon. During this period, folks of charming
colorful insects called 'Lebang' use to visit hill slopes in search of seeds sewn on it. The annual visit of the insects renders
the tribal youths to indulge in merry-making. While the men-folk make a peculiar rhythmic sound with the help of two bamboo
chips in their hand, the women folk run tottering the hill slopes to catch hold of these insects called 'Lebang'. The rhythm
of the sound made by the bamboo chips attracts the insects from their hiding places and the women in-groups catch them. With
the change of time Jhuming on hill slopes are gradually diminishing. But the cultural life that developed centering round the
Jhum delved deep into the society. It still exists in the state's hills and dales as a reminiscence of the life, which
tribal of today cherish in memory, and preserve as treasure. In both the dances Tripuris use the musical instruments like
Khamb made of Bamboo, Flute, Sarinda, Lebang made of bamboo and bamboo cymbal. Tripuri women generally put on indigenous
ornaments like chain made of silver with coin, Bangle made of silver, ear and nose rings made of bronze. They prefer flower
as ornaments.</dd>
